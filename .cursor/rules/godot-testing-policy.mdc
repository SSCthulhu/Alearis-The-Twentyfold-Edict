# Godot Game Testing Policy

## Never Test the Game

**IMPORTANT**: Do not launch, run, or test the Godot game. The user will handle all testing.

### What NOT to do:
- ❌ Do not use `user-godot-mcp-play_scene`
- ❌ Do not use `user-godot-mcp-simulate_input`
- ❌ Do not use `user-godot-mcp-get_running_scene_screenshot`
- ❌ Do not attempt to control or interact with the running game

### What TO do:
- ✅ Make changes to scenes, scripts, and assets
- ✅ Check for errors using `user-godot-mcp-get_godot_errors` (compile/syntax errors)
- ✅ Take editor screenshots using `user-godot-mcp-get_editor_screenshot`
- ✅ Explain what was changed and let the user test

## After Making Changes

After implementing features or fixes:
1. Summarize what was changed
2. Ask the user to test it
3. Wait for their feedback before proceeding
